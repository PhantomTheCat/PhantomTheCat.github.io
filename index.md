### Projects 

[A CATastrophe: A Murder Mystery (C# Console Version)](/sample_page) <br>
Description: Is a murder mystery game that I made, where the player moves around rooms, finds evidence, and interrogates family members to find the murderer. It is also run in a loop that will tell the amount of turns left to the player, and if they cannot find the murderer in that turn limit, they lose. One of the biggest challenges that I overcame was incorporating random, where I made it so that, depending on circumstances, the player gets random responses from the suspects.

Description: Another programming project that I made for fun that will get input from player and display that information in a custom sentence. It's really basic because it was one of the first projects I made, where it shows that I know string interpolation.
